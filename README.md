# API with NodeJS, MongoDB and Hapi
Example of a simple API using NodeJS, MongoDB and Hapi.

## Functions
Go to http://localhost:4000/documentation to see the work done with Swagger (documentation). To work with GraphQL API, go to http://localhost:4000/graphiql. Finally, if there is a bug, don't hesitate asking me. It should return a JSON object with data that belongs to Mona Lisa painting (The main difference between the original project is that my API return an array of strings related to the "techniques" field of a painting). Enjoy it (see main page at http://localhost:4000/)!
